"How do I know if Im a Junior Dev?" is a common question for those new in their career and particular when suffering from [impostor syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome).

There are great answers online and want to add an additional _unusual_ answer, not as a perfect guide but a [rule of thumb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_thumb).

### A gaming community comparison

Following a few different video game subreddits and I often see two types of posters:

- **The experienced player**: Examples include long winded monologues about how a bad the latest patch breaks the games balance, how the technical implementation of anti-aliasing is inefficient or how a team threw a match by not understanding the latest meta.
- **The new player**: Usually a person saying how they brought the game on sale, love it and just played for five hours straight.

It's kind of fun seeing how prevalent both types of posters are and how it difficult it is to understand sentiment on the game.

Personally I'm in the middle. I enjoy games, follow the drama but I don't tend to post content and infrequently comment at all. If we believe the [1% Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule), most users are like me.

### Applying this to programming

Projecting this to our programming communities, I think its possible to see where you may be on the bell curve.

- Excited and want to tell the world? Got many questions? Do you post your questions publicly? You're probably just starting out and falling in love with programming.
- If you tend not to post, you know enough what to search for. This is the professionally employed, know enough to finish a project, getting things done at work silent majority I would say.
- Do you spend most of your time either answering questions or raging about how bad the Java GC is? You're likely to be experienced enough in particular tech stack to know why something is good, and bad, at the same time. You're deep enough to be frustrated by how _almost_ perfect a solution is.

### Not a one size fits all

There are some fairly obvious flaws to this perspective. There are many extremely talented developers who don't post or blog.

You could even argue that due to the [Dunningâ€“Kruger effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect) that the more you know, the less you post.

I think this has merit, but I would counter that while experienced developers post less frequently, they probably post better quality content as they are likely to only post on topics they feel strong mastery over.

Ultimately, I suggest this is for discerning the different between a 'Junior' developer and everyone else.

### TLDR;

If you find yourself perhaps not posting as many questions (but instead instinctively knowing what to search or even helping others) I believe you've shown signs that you are no longer a Junior developer.
