I don't really like blogging as a concept. My reaction is due to the tech world insisting [every](https://roelofjanelsinga.com/articles/top-10-reasons-to-start-blogging-as-software-engineer/) [engineer](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/every-developer-should-have-a-blog-heres-why-and-how-to-stick-with-it-5fd55a247fbf/) [should](https://www.workflowmax.com/blog/25-must-read-blogs-for-engineers) [be](https://online-engineering.case.edu/blog/best-engineering-blogs-2020) [blogging](https://towardsdatascience.com/5-engineering-blogs-you-should-follow-bc897512639e) and [how you should feel bad if you don't](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13733624). I'm a fairly private person with little to no online presence.

Despite this I've wanted to blog for a few years. As a side effect, I'm pretty guilty for sending my friends walls of text about my diehard feelings on various tech topics. They reply suggesting I start a blog -  *I suspect as a coping mechanism*.

Theres a few reasons I feel apprehensive about blogging:

- I don't feel like my writing skills are up to task.
- I'm not sure if my ideas are interesting enough for *an entire* lengthy post.
- It feels hipster and a bit **look at me**.
- I'm afraid that I'll stop and people will see a blog thats clearly failed.
- Bloggers seems obsessed with making *money*.

For me it all comes down to **motivation**. I'll blog only when I have something interesting to say. There wont be a regular schedule but when I do post I hope its interesting.
