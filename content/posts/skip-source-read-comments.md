Anyone who has been on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/news) or [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com) long enough knows the meta joke - skip the source and go straight to the comments.

It gives both site's an air of group think that the content is *always* the site itself, so why bother reading the linked source? If it's really good, it will be quoted or just pasted in a top comment anyway..?

While an infinite amount of apes typing in [/r/Superstonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/), can create Shakespeare, often it just recreates the same thread over and over again.

## A posts lifecycle

Getting points on Reddit or Hacker News is fairly easy but you'll want to act quickly, so skim the post title, find the technology and post a familiar but easily disputed talking point:

- *"Java? isn't that an old slow language?"*
- *"PHP is always insecure, I don't know why people use it!"*
- *"Node's ecosystem is dangerous.."*
- *"Why didn't they use TypeScript?/Go/Rust??"*

After enough random comments to move the post from the *new*, more people will show up and dispute these claims. Don't worry, they wont need to read the article either.

- *"Wait, until you hear about how many sites run Wordpress.."*
- *"Have you heard about Laravel? it's actually okay for PHP"*
- *"Try Deno/Yarn/nvm, it's much better than npm"*
- *"Go/Rust is a fad"
- *"I don't understand why we need TypeScript, JavaScript is fine"*

## The reaction to the reaction

Eventually discussions of discussions will occur. Why PHP is so popular, do you need to learn a new language at all, the mandatory link to a relevant [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/), TypeScript is good actually, webpack is an abomination and needs to be destroyed etc.

I don't hate this, but I do wonder why it's so common to seek new content when no one is reading the linked source. 

Isn't it ironic how such a countercultures are so against to being manipulated, and have such strong rules to stop 'reposts' has it'self, become a factory for re-posting comments? For once, I don't think this is a meme meta joke.

## It's not just the readers who miss out

While the linked source is probably happy they get *any* traffic, we're training authors to write good **titles** and [use A.I. to write the article](https://www.techradar.com/uk/best/ai-writer). 

They aren't stupid and this game has become well established at this point. Want good traffic, make good title, skip the article body.

## Why it happens

I believe this all happens because both in source and in comments, people want to be noticed and heard. Even if what they are saying is the same as before. 

It's like a weird internet nostalgia ritual *you say x, I say y back* and I don't think it's inherently harmful as long as we acknowledge what's happening. 

You *might* learn something great in a comments section, but often you wasted some time in your day. it's internet comfort food and thats okay. So lets stop pretending it's all Shakespeare.
