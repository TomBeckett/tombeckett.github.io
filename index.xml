      <description>Five years ago I moved to Spring Boot from ASP.NET. Frankly, I found Java and the Spring Framework confusing and it was not my choice to use it.
Since then I&amp;rsquo;ve used many other backend technologies (Ruby on Rails, ASP.NET Core, Express/TypeScript) but I keep coming back to Spring. I&amp;rsquo;ve really had a change of heart with Spring.
Over those years I&amp;rsquo;ve had to teach many others about Spring and common questions come up:</description>

      <title>Spring Boot: Magic Beans</title>

      <description>A common complaint about Spring refers to Spring Magic and general confusion about how dependency injection works in Spring. It can be extremely confusing to get a stacktrace like this:
Error creating bean with name &amp;#39;beanA&amp;#39;: Injection of autowired dependencies failed; nested exception is org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanCreationException: Could not autowire field: private com.example.demo.BeanB com.example.demo.BeanA.dependency; nested exception is org.springframework.beans.factory.NoSuchBeanDefinitionException: No qualifying bean of type [com.example.demo.BeanB] found for dependency: expected at least 1 bean which qualifies as autowire candidate for this dependency.</description>

      <title>Why blog? Why now?</title>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t really like blogging as a concept. My reaction is due to the tech world insisting every engineer should be blogging and how you should feel bad if you don&amp;rsquo;t. I&amp;rsquo;m a fairly private person with little to no online presence.
Despite this I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to blog for a few years. As a side effect, I&amp;rsquo;m pretty guilty for sending my friends walls of text about my diehard feelings on various tech topics.</description>
