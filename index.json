[{"content":"I don\u0026rsquo;t really like blogging as a concept. My reaction is due to the tech world inisiting every engineer should be blogging and how you should feel bad if you dont. I\u0026rsquo;m a fairly private person with little to no online presence.\nDespite this I\u0026rsquo;ve wanted to blog for a few years. As a side effect, I\u0026rsquo;m pretty guilty for sending my friends walls of text about my diehard feelings on various tech topics. They reply suggesting I start a blog - I suspect as a coping mechanism.\nTheres a few reasons I feel apprehensive about blogging:\n I don\u0026rsquo;t feel like my writing skills are up to task. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if my ideas are interesting enough for an entire lengthy post. It feels hipster and a bit look at me. I\u0026rsquo;m affraid that I\u0026rsquo;ll stop and people will see a blog thats clearly failed. Bloggers seems obsessed with making money.  For me it all comes down to motivation. I\u0026rsquo;ll blog only when I have something interesting to say. There wont be a regular schedule but when I do post I hope its interesting.\n","permalink":"https://tombeckett.github.io/posts/why-blog/","summary":"I don\u0026rsquo;t really like blogging as a concept.
